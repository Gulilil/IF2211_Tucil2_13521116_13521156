## **Program Description**
This program uses python programming language and is a **command line interface (CLI)** based program. The main program is to find the closest pair of dots in N-Dimension plane. This program is being made with Divide and Conquer algorithm with the Brute Force algorithm as its comparison. This program also uses the python **matplotlib.pyplot** library to visualize the closest pair of dots found in 3 dimension plane.   

## **Required Program**
To compile this program, you will need to install **Python** on the device you are using. You may click the [link here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install it.
After installing **Python** you will need to install the library.
Since this program is using the matplotlib library, you might need to install it if you have not installed it before.
Here are the commands you can use to install the matplotlib library.
```
python -m pip install -U pip
```
```
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
